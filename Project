# Project
Muskan Kapoor and Michelle Lucero 

Choice 1: We wanted to start with the inverted index and add the ability to do AND, NOT, and OR queries. 
We will find an alternate data set from which we will base our project upon. 
We wanted to ultimately  display our data and put it up as a web app (FLASK).
